## Weather Stratification
# The weather data contains a list of meteorological variables. The variables we would use
# to stratify tripdates include:
# 1. body temperature (feelslike) in celcius
# 2. precip (precip) in mm
# 3. total fall amount (totalsnow) in cm
# 4. wind speed (wspd) in km/h

# 1. Apparent Temperature
# By inspecting the distributions, we made a judgment call to remove days with
# apparent temperatures below -10 째C (14 째F) and above 23 째C (73 째F).
# The thresholds are visualized in red vertical lines in the histogram.
